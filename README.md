This is a data science walkthrough/tutorial for a final project for a Introduction to Data Science class. Coded in python, it utilizes pandas, matplotlib, folium, and sklearn. The dataset used is Washington Post's US fatal shootings from 2015 - present. As described in their Github "The Post is documenting only those shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian â€” the circumstances that most closely parallel the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., which began the protest movement culminating in Black Lives Matter and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths."
